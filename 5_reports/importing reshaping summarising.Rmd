```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)

data(gapminder)
gapminder_csv <- read_csv("../1_data/gapminder.csv")
gapminder_wide_csv <- read_csv("../1_data/gapminder_wide.csv")


```

## Making data tidy

unique variables for each column.
gapminder_wide is not like that...it has gdp_per_cap_1952, gdp_per_cap_1953...etc...

This is similar to what you often see on a website - with the data dates across the page.  eg. world bank or covid data for countries

Need to reshape...
```{r}
gap_long <- gapminder_wide_csv %>%
  gather(key, value, -continent, -country) %>%
  separate(key, c("variable_name","year"), "_") %>%
  spread(variable_name, value) %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year))
  
# the first column is called 'key'.  the 'values' are called value.  Continent and country are ignored
# for more, see the video - this is explained
#spread variable_name, value - makes the variable names into columns, and then assigns the values to them.
```
